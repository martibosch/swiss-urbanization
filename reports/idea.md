1. Introduction

* Need to quantitatively understand the landscape changes associated with urbanization
* Landscape ecology perspective
  * Studies of the spatiotemporal patterns of land use change
  * Gradient analysis
* Other approaches to the spatial organization of cities
  * Location theory
  * Fractal analysis
* Objectives
  * Test the diffusion and coalescence hypothesis
  * Test the three growth modes hypothesis
  * Test what new insights we obtain by combining the two hypothesis with fractal scaling

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Study area

2.2 Data sources

2.3 Quantifying spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization

* Diffusion and coalescence

| Metric        | Diffusion and coalescence | Bern |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ---- |
| MPS           | Decrease with diffusion, reach a minimum and increase with coalescence | Increase (inner and outer) |
| PD            | Increase with diffusion, reach apex and decrease with coalescence | Irregular
| ED            | Increase with diffusion, reach apex and decrease with coalescence | Decrease (inner) and increase (outer)
| AWMFD         | Increase with diffusion, reach apex and decrease with coalescence | Decrease (inner) and increase (outer)
| ENN           | Increase with diffusion, reach apex and decrease with coalescence |
| CONTAG        | Decrease with diffusion, reach a minimum and increase with coalescence | Increase (inner) and decrease (outer)


3. Results
 
3.1 Time series of landscape metrics

3.2 Growth modes

3.3 Fractal aspects of urban patterns

4. Discussion

4.1 Testing hypotheses of urbanization patterns

* Mixed support for diffusion and coalescence hypothesis

4.2 Bi-fractal city model

* Two distinct behaviors for two distinct zones

4.3 Limitations

* Size is the main predictor
* Agglomeration definitions are problematic

4.4 Planning implications

* Zurich manages to preserve a large urban natural interface despite significant infilling (by preserving shape complexity)

5. Conclusions
